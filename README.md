Diabetes Risk Prediction from Health Records
üìå Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using health indicators such as Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, Insulin, and Skin Thickness. By applying data science techniques and machine learning models, this project demonstrates how early detection can help in prevention and effective healthcare planning.

Dataset Used: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset
